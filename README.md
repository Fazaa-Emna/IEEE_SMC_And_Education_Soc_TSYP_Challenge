# **Student Health and Performance Study**

This project was conducted for the **IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (IEEE SMCS)** in collaboration with the **IEEE Education Society** during the renowned **Tunisian Students and Young Professionals (TSYP) Congress**. The focus of the project was to explore the relationship between **psychological flexibility** and **physical and mental illness**, and how these factors may affect students' academic performance.

## **Study Overview**

We conducted an extensive study on multiple variables that potentially influence students' performance. The primary aim was to uncover the connections between psychological flexibility and the physical and mental health of students. Understanding these relationships can provide valuable insights into enhancing both the well-being and academic success of students.

## **Results Summary**

- **Psychological flexibility is...**
  - Highly variant across demographics:
    - **Most significant factors:** Gender, religiousness, field of study, age
  - Strongly correlated with depression and anxiety in US college students:
    - **Correlation coefficients (r):** 0.67 for depression, 0.66 for anxiety
  - 10x more important than any other demographic variable in predicting depression & anxiety:
    - **Using just AAQ:** Accuracy = 88+%
  - Potentially capable of 3x return-on-investment in reducing the likelihood of mental illness:
    - **Boost AAQ by 2%:** 6% decrease in probability of depression & anxiety
    - **Boost AAQ by 20%:** 60% decrease in probability of depression & anxiety
